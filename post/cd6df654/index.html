              <p>200<br>Some people stood on the small pier. They saw a boat approach. The boat was approaching fast. The boat was approaching the small pier. Was the boat going to stop? People started running. They started running off the pier. They were worried. They were worried about the boat. The boat kept coming. It didn’t slow down. One man stood on the pier. He didn’t run. He yelled at the boat. He waved his arms. He yelled, “Stop! Stop! You’re going to crash!” But the boat didn’t stop. It kept coming. The man kept yelling. The boat kept coming. Is the driver drunk, the man wondered. He ran as fast as he could. He ran off the pier. The boat crashed into the pier.<br>一些人站在小码头。他们看到一条船靠近。该船即将快速来临。该艇驶近小码头。船会停下来吗？人们开始奔跑。他们开始逃离码头。他们担心。他们担心船。船保持靠近。它并没有放慢。一名男子站在码头。他没有跑。他冲向船。他挥舞着双臂。他喊道：“住手！ 停止！你要撞上了！”但船上没有停止。它不断靠近。该男子不停地吆喝着。船不断靠近。是司机喝醉了，那人想。他尽可能的跑快。他逃离了码头。船撞进码头。</p>
<p>199<br>He dropped his toothbrush. It fell on the floor. He picked up his toothbrush. He rinsed it off. He brushed his teeth. He rinsed his mouth. He walked out of the bathroom. He sat on his bed. He felt something. It was under the sheet. He took the sheet off the bed. Something was in his mattress. It was a brand new mattress. He had bought it yesterday. What is in the mattress, he wondered. He went to the kitchen. He took a knife from the kitchen drawer. He cut open the mattress. What could it be, he wondered. It was small. It was black. It was a book. It was the New Testament. Is God trying to tell me something, he wondered.<br>他掉了他的牙刷。它摔在地板上。他拿起牙刷。他冲洗它。他刷了牙。他清洗他的嘴。他走出浴室。他坐在自己的床上。他感觉到了什么。它在被单下面。他把被单从床上拿开。有什么东西在他的床垫里。这是一个全新的床垫。他昨天买的它。什么在床垫里，他不知道。他去了厨房。他从厨房的抽屉里拿了一把刀。他剖开的床垫。 可能是什么，他在想。它是小的。它是黑色的。这是一本书。它是新约全书。是上帝想告诉我什么，他在想。</p>
<p>198<br>He called up the post office. “Where is my package?” he asked. “What is the tracking number?” the postal worker asked. He told her the tracking number. She said, “Your package is at the main post office. You can pick it up anytime.” He said, “I don’t want to pick it up. Can you deliver it?” She said yes. “We will deliver it on Monday,” she said. “Will you be home?” He said, “What time on Monday?” She said, “Anytime between 8 a.m. and 5 p.m.” He said, “I have to work. I can’t stay home all day.” She said, “That’s okay. We can deliver it on Tuesday.” He said, “I have to work on Tuesday, too. Please deliver it on Saturday.”<br>他打电话给邮局。“我的包裹在哪里?”他问道。“什么是跟踪号码吗?”邮政工人问。他告诉她的跟踪号码。她说,“你的包裹在主要邮局。你可以随时把它取回去。”他说,“我不想把它取回来。你能送它吗?她说,是的。“我们将在周一送。”她说。”“你会在家吗?”他说,“周一什么时候?”她说,“在上午8点到下午5点。”他说,“我得工作。我不能整天呆在家里。”她说,“没关系。我们可以周二送。”他说:“我周二必须工作。请周六送。”</p>
<p>197<br>He couldn’t find his pen. Where is my pen, he wondered. He looked for his pen. It was on top of the microwave. He couldn’t find his cell phone. Where is my cell phone, he wondered. He looked for his cell phone. It was on top of the TV. He couldn’t find his glasses. Where are my glasses, he wondered. He looked for his glasses. They were on top of his head. I’m tired of looking for everything, he thought. He invented a tiny video recorder. It recorded everything he did. It recorded everywhere he went. He couldn’t find his toothbrush. Where is my toothbrush, he wondered. He played his tiny video recorder. He found his toothbrush. He didn’t have to look for it.<br>他找不到他的钢笔。我的钢笔在哪里,他不知道。他寻找他的钢笔。他在微波炉上面。他找不到他的手机。我的手机在哪里,他不知道。他找他的手机。它在电视上面。他不能找到他的眼镜。我的眼镜在哪里,他不知道。他寻找他的眼镜。他在他的头上。我厌倦了寻找一切,他想。他发明了一种微型录像机。它记录了他所做的一切。它所到之处都记录下来。他找不到他的牙刷。我的牙刷在哪里,他不知道。他打开微型录像机。他发现他的牙刷。他没有一定去寻找它。</p>
<p>196<br>The days were hot. The nights were hot. He turned on the living room fan. He turned on the dining room fan. Both fans were on high speed. They made a lot of noise. But they didn’t blow cool air. They blew hot air. They blew hot air everywhere. He turned off the fans. He turned on the air conditioner. He closed all the windows. He closed the front door. The apartment began to cool down. It got cooler and cooler. Then he heard a bang. It was a loud bang. He thought a plane had crashed onto the roof. But it wasn’t a plane. It was the air conditioner compressor. It had broken down. He opened the door. He opened the windows.<br>天是热的。晚上都热。他打开了客厅的风扇。他打开了餐厅的风扇。所有的风扇都在高速运作。他们发出很大的噪音。但是他们没有吹凉风。他们吹热气。他们吹的热空气无处不在。他关掉风扇。他打开了空调。 他关闭了所有的窗口。他关上了前门。公寓开始降温。它更凉快，更凉快。然后他听到砰的一声。这是一声巨响。他认为一架飞机坠毁在屋顶上。但是不是一个飞机。这是空调压缩机。它坏了。他打开了门。他打开窗户。</p>
<p>195<br>His laptop sat on his desk. His laptop always overheated. It always overheated quickly. How could he keep it cool? He turned on his living room fan. It cooled his laptop. But the fan blew dust around. It blew paper around. He turned off his living room fan. He thought. He thought some more. How could he keep his laptop cool? He had an idea. He bought little plastic blocks. Each block was one inch square. He put the laptop on top of the blocks. One block was under each corner of the laptop. Now the laptop sat a little above the desk. There was space under the laptop. There was space for cool air to flow. The cool air prevented overheating.<br>他的笔记本电脑在他的办公桌上。他的笔记本电脑总是过热。它总是很快就热了。怎么能保持他凉呢?他打开客厅的风扇。它吹着他的笔记本电脑。但风扇吹得到处是灰尘。它吹得到处是纸。他关掉了客厅的风扇。他想，他想了好多。怎么能使他的笔记本电脑降温呢?他有了一个主意。他买了小塑料块。每一块是一英寸。他把笔记本放在塑料块上。一个塑料块在笔记本电脑的一个脚上。 现在笔记本电脑上坐着一个小桌子上。笔记本电脑下面有了空间。空气在空间中流动。凉爽的空气防止过热。<br>194<br>Alex wanted to become a citizen. He signed up for a citizenship class. He went to the first class. The teacher spoke only Spanish. All the other students spoke only Spanish. Alex spoke Spanish, too. He asked the teacher, “Why are you speaking Spanish? We need to speak English. We need to understand English. We need to read English. We need to write English.” The teacher said, “Don’t worry. English isn’t important anymore. My students never fail the interview. Can you say Yes in English? Can you say No in English? Then your English is good enough. You want to become a citizen. That is more important than your English.” Alex dropped out. He signed up for another citizenship class. The teacher spoke only English.<br>亚历克斯想成为公民。他报名参加了一个公民课。他去了第一节课。老师只讲西班牙语。所有其他的学生只会说西班牙语。亚历克斯也说西班牙语。他问老师,你为什么说西班牙语吗?我们需要讲英语。我们需要懂英语。 我们需要读英语。我们需要写英语。老师说,别担心。英语并不重要了。我的学生从不会在面试中失败。你可以用英语说是吗?你能用英语说“不”吗?那么你的英语就足够好了。你想成为公民。这是比你的英语更重要。亚历克斯辍学。他报名了另一个公民班。老师只讲英语。<br>193<br>The man walked into a bank. He wore a hoody. He wore gloves. It was summertime. It was hot outside. No one else was wearing a hoody. No one else was wearing gloves. The bank guard looked at the man. “Why are you wearing a hoody?” the bank guard asked. “Why are you wearing gloves?” The man said he had a disease. He had a contagious disease. He coughed. He coughed again. The bank guard backed away. He did not want to get a disease. He stopped watching the man. He watched other people enter the bank. He forgot about the man with the contagious disease. A few minutes later, the man ran out of the bank. He was carrying a money bag.<br>那人走进了银行。他穿着一套头衫。他戴手套。 这是夏季。外面很热。没有其他的人穿着一套头衫。没有其他的人戴着手套。银行保安看着那个男人。“你为什么穿套头衫?”银行保安问道。 “你为什么戴手套?”那人说他病了。他有一种传染性疾病。 他咳嗽。他又咳嗽。银行保安后退走开了。 他不想得到疾病。他停止看这个人。他看着别人进入银行。他忘记了传染性疾病的人。 几分钟后,那人跑出了银行。他带着装钱的袋子。<br>192</p>
<p>The police chief said CRIme was down. “CRIme is down,” said police chief Braddon. He talked to TV reporters. He talked to newspaper reporters. He talked to radio reporters. He was proud. “I’m proud,” he said. “Our police are doing a good job. I’m proud of our police.” He said CRIme was down 50 percent. “What kinds of crime?” asked a reporter. “All kinds of crime,” said Braddon. “Bicycle theft is down 60 percent. Cell phone theft is down 55 percent. Computer theft is down 50 percent.” He didn’t say anything about other crimes. “What about other crimes?” asked a reporter. “What other crimes?” asked Braddon. “You should be happy with this news. Report it to the public. The public will be happy, too.”<br>警察局长说犯罪下降了。“犯罪在下降，”警察局长布拉德说。他跟电视记者说。他跟报纸记者说。他对电台记者说。他感到自豪。“我感到自豪,”他说。我们的警察正在做一份好工作。 我为我们的警察感到骄傲。他说犯罪下降了50%。“什么类型的犯罪?”记者问。 “各种各样的犯罪,”位于说。自行车盗窃是下降了60%。手机盗窃是下降了55%。计算机盗窃是下降了50%。他没有说任何关于其他罪行。 “其他罪行呢?”记者问。“其他罪行什么?”布拉德问道。 你应该满意这个消息。 向公众报告。公众会很高兴。<br>191<br>“I’m not coming to this art fair again,” said Molly. “Why aren’t you coming to this art fair again?” asked Teri. “There aren’t enough visitors,” Molly said. “That’s for sure,” said Teri. “There aren’t enough visitors spending money.” “That’s for sure,” said Molly. Visitors stopped and looked at Molly’s paintings. Visitors stopped and looked at Teri’s paintings. Visitors said Molly’s paintings were very nice. Visitors said Teri’s paintings were very nice. But no one bought anything. “No one buys anything,” said Molly. “They stop. They look. They say, ‘Oh, how pretty.’ Then they walk on.” Molly and Teri had not sold one painting. They lowered their prices. They put “Sale! 50% Off!” tags on all their paintings. But no one bought a single painting.<br>“我不会再来这艺术博览会,”莫利说。“你为什么不再来这个艺术博览会了?”泰瑞问道。“没有足够的游客,”莫利说。 “那是肯定的,”泰瑞说。“没有足够的游客花钱。” “那是肯定的,”莫利说。游客停下来看着莫莉的绘画。游客停下来看着泰瑞的绘画。游客说,莫莉的画非常好。游客说泰瑞的画非常好。但是没有人买任何东西。“没有人购买任何东西,”莫利说。“他们停止。他们看起来。他们说,‘哦,真漂亮。然后他们走。”莫莉,泰瑞没有卖出一幅画。他们降低了价格。他们把“出售50% !”标签在所有他们的画作上。但是没有人买一幅画。<br>190<br>It was time for the annual blood drive. He told his girlfriend, “I’m going to give blood tomorrow.” She said, “Don’t do that. You could get a disease.” He asked, “I could get a disease? How could I get a disease?” She said, “You never know. What if a nurse trips and stabs you with a dirty needle?” He said that was ridiculous. Nurses don’t trip. Nurses don’t stab blood donors with dirty needles. He went to the blood drive the next day. He watched the nurses carefully. None of them tripped. None of them stabbed a blood donor with a dirty needle. He gave blood. He told his girlfriend that no one had tripped and stabbed him. She said he was lucky this time.<br>这是年度献血运动的时间。他对他的女朋友说:“我明天去献血。”她说,“不要这样做。你会得一种疾病。”他问:“我可以得一种疾病?我怎么能得一种疾病?”她说,你永远不会知道的。比如护士犯错以及刺穿你用脏的针头?他说这是荒谬的。护士不会弄错。护士不会用肮脏的针头刺伤献血者。第二天他去了献血运动。他仔细地看着护士。没有一个人犯错。没有人用脏的针头刺伤一个献血者。他献了血。他告诉他的女朋友,没有人犯错刺伤他。她说他这次是幸运的。<br>189<br>He stopped at the motel. It was late at night. It was almost midnight. He asked the motel clerk, “Do you have a vacant room?” She said she had a vacant room. He asked how much it was. She said it was $100 for the night. “But the night is half over,” he said. “Can I pay half price for the room?” She said yes. “But there is one condition,” she said. “If we only get half, you only get half. You must sleep on only one-half of the bed. You can use only one of the two pillows. The bathroom has hot and cold water faucets. You can use only one faucet. The cable TV has 100 channels. You can watch only 50 channels.”<br>他停在旅馆。这是深夜。 它几乎是午夜了。他问旅馆的售货员,“你有空房吗?”她说她有一个空房间。他问多少钱。她说一晚上是100美元。“但是晚上还剩下一半,”他说。“我可以支付一半价格的房间吗?”她说可以。“但有一个条件,”她说。如果我们只得到一半,你只有一半。你必须睡在只有一半的床上。您可以使用两个枕头中的一个。浴室有冷热水龙头。您可以使用一个水龙头。有线电视有100个频道。你只能看到50频道。<br>188<br>Brad was angry.
